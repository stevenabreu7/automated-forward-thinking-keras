# Automated Forward Thinking in Keras

This repository provides a Python Keras implementation to an automated adaption of the Forward Thinking algorithm proposed by Hettinger et al. in 2017. The code shows a deep feedforward neural network trained in a greedy layer-wise manner with automated layer construction (rather than pre-defined layer sizes as in the original paper).
